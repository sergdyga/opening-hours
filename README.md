* __POST__ `v1/formatHours` - accepts map with separate key for each day of the week.
  `value` - stands for seconds from beginning *of the day*
    - Order of input hours does not affect result
    - Days of week names are case-insensitive
    - Missing or empty `[]` day of the week means - closed

    {

      "value": 32400
    },
